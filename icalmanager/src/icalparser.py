'''Parser for iCal data

Parses the needed data from iCal file into form which is useful for other apps.
This means mostly discarding data not needed, but also converting timestamps to
a standard form and removing extra whitespace and escape characters.'''

    Returns a list of dicts with only current and future events.'''

def _transform_timestamp(timestamp, offset):
    '''Transforms timestamps to standard form and UTC time.
    
    The iCal format accepts many different time representations.
    Change them all to a single standard for easier future use.
    The format used is "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z", which is commonly
    in use and follows ISO 8601.
    
    Returns timestamp as a string.'''

def _sanitize_text(input):
    '''Sanitizes text fields.

    Removes extra whitespace and escape characters from the text given.

    When a whitespace character appears multiple times in row, leave only
    one, except in case of newline, leave two.
    
    When an escaped character (e.g. \') is found, transform to SQL-accepted
    form.
    
    Returns the sanitized text as a string.'''
